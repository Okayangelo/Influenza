# Influenza Analysis & Staffing

## Overview
Hello, I am Angelo. During the influenza season, hospitals and clinics require additional temporary staff to adequately treat vulnerable elderly and young populations who develop serious flu complications and end up in the hospital. This project analyzes the USA influenza season to understand the who, when, and where of the disease with the goal of providing sufficient healthcare staff more efficiently and effectively.

## Project Goals
- **Identify vulnerable populations:** Understand which demographics are most affected by influenza.
- **Seasonal analysis:** Determine the peak times during the influenza season.
- **Geographical insights:** Pinpoint regions with the highest incidence rates.
- **Staffing recommendations:** Provide actionable insights for healthcare staffing needs.

## Data Set
The dataset includes historical influenza data from various sources in the USA, covering:
- **Demographic information:** Age, gender, and other relevant factors.
- **Temporal data:** Timeframes of influenza outbreaks.
- **Geographical data:** Locations of reported influenza cases.

## Tools
- **Tableau Public:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Summary
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the influenza season in the USA to help hospitals and clinics prepare for staffing needs. By understanding the who, when, and where of influenza outbreaks, healthcare facilities can ensure they have adequate staff to handle the increased patient load during peak flu season.
